# VOTEZ


VOTEZ is an online voting system leveraging blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and decentralized elections. Built with Ethereum, Solidity, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Truffle, VOTEZ provides a robust platform for managing elections. Admins can add candidates and verify voters, while users can register, cast votes, and view results after the election concludes.

# üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Why did I build this?

I created VOTEZ to tackle the common issues in traditional voting systems, such as security concerns, lack of transparency, and accessibility problems. By integrating blockchain technology, VOTEZ ensures that every vote is securely recorded and transparently managed. My goal is to provide a seamless, trustworthy, and efficient voting experience for both voters and administrators.
# üõ†Ô∏è Local development

That's pretty easy. To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, we would recommend you to have <b>[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)</b>, and <b>[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)</b> installed.

Also, download [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/) on your system, and run it by quickstart.

Then, install Truffle using :
```sh
npm install -g truffle
```

Also, download [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/download/) for your browser. And, import 3-4 accounts from Ganache using private keys. 

We will first start with setting up the Local Project Environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tathagat27/VOTEZ.git

cd VOTEZ

npm install

cd /client

npm run dev:install

```



Now we are all set to run the app ‚úîÔ∏è

On the root level run the following command:

```sh
truffle migrate --network development --reset
```

And, you are all set to use this application üöÄ
